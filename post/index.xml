      <description>Let’s talk about R and Python! Some background information based completely off what I know/remember:
Python is one of the most user friendly coding languages that exist, it was actually named after the movie monty python and the holy grail (hilarious movie, 10/10 recommend). Also made fairly recently, 1990s I believe (#90skids).
R is for really for science nerds. Like myself and probably you, since you’re reading a R-coded website right now :) But it is also pretty neat if I say so myself.</description>
